A program that removes ads from Wuolah-generated PDFs.

Are you tired of having dozens of ads in your Wuolah PDFs, when you're just trying to study for the exam?<br>
Just drag and drop your Wuolah files into the program, and they'll instantly be distraction-free!

A new folder called "Wuolan't" will be automatically created, where your ad-less PDFs will be placed. Enjoy!<br>
(The program is pretty hacky in the way it filters out the ads, so I can't promise it'll work on *every* PDF)
